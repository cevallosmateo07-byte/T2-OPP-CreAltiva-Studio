##  PROBLEM
#### In  photography studio, scheduling appointments manually can cause the many problems, such as confusing schedules, forgetting bookings, failing to properly follow up with the clients. Furthermore, this method requires someone to be constantly answering messages or the calls, which makes the job more complicated and less organized. Therefore, an automated system is neededs to helps schedule photo sessions more easily and quickly offer a better experience for clients, and can sync with the tools like Google Calendar to keep everything organized.

## OVERVIEW
### Because of the problems of scheduling manually our client asks us to make a form to automatize this system but also connect it to his personal calendar this because his calendar can be automatically updated being this very useful to him to not waste time in clients that doesn`t appoint meetings this chatbot can filter them this being very useful to the photography studio to be more productive and also have an organized agenda.
## Background
## The chatbot will help the user in scheduling appointments, adapting it to use natural language. The main tasks are registering requests and checking availability. For this, a synchronized calendar will be used, allowing you to create, modify, and delete events easily.
